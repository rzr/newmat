Description: matrix manipulations C++ library
 Newmat library is intended for scientists and engineers 
 who need to manipulate a variety of types of matrices 
 using standard matrix operations.
 Emphasis is on the kind of operations needed in statistical calculations
 such as least squares, linear equation solve and eigenvalues.
 .
 Newmat supports matrix types: Matrix (rectangular matrix); 
 UpperTriangularMatrix; LowerTriangularMatrix; DiagonalMatrix; 
 SymmetricMatrix; BandMatrix; UpperBandMatrix; LowerBandMatrix; 
 SymmetricBandMatrix; IdentityMatrix;
 RowVector; ColumnVector.
 .
 Only one element type (float or double) is supported (default is double).
 .
 The library includes the operations *, +, -, *=, +=, -=, Kronecker product,
 Schur product, concatenation, inverse, transpose, conversion between types,
 submatrix, determinant, Cholesky decomposition, QR triangularisation,
 singular value decomposition, eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix, sorting,
 fast Fourier and trig. transforms and printing.
